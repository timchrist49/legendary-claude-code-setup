# Claude Code Operating Context

> Production-ready development environment with MCP tools, skills, and behavioral rules.
> Generated by Claude Code Super Setup

## Context Imports

Read and follow these files in order of priority:

1. `@RULES.md` - Core behavioral rules (highest priority)
2. `@PRINCIPLES.md` - Development principles
3. MCP Guidelines (load when using specific tools):
   - `@MCP/MCP_Context7.md` - Documentation lookup
   - `@MCP/MCP_Tavily.md` - Web search
   - `@MCP/MCP_Browserbase.md` - Cloud browser
   - `@MCP/MCP_Playwright.md` - Browser automation
   - `@MCP/MCP_Strawberry.md` - Verification
   - `@MCP/MCP_GitHub.md` - Repository operations
   - `@MCP/MCP_E2B.md` - Sandboxed code execution
   - `@MCP/MCP_SequentialThinking.md` - Problem decomposition

## Prime Directive

Ship production-ready code for MVPs quickly with:
- Correct dependencies (verified via Context7)
- Current information (verified via Tavily)
- Minimal hallucination (verified via Strawberry)
- Working implementations (tested via Playwright)

## Default Workflow

```
1. CLARIFY   → Write short spec (bullets, requirements)
2. RESEARCH  → Use Tavily/Context7 to verify approaches
3. PLAN      → Create implementation plan with milestones
4. IMPLEMENT → Execute in small, testable batches
5. VERIFY    → Test each change, run Strawberry on claims
6. COMMIT    → Keep changes small and atomic
```

## MCP Tool Selection Matrix

| Need | Primary Tool | Fallback |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Library/API docs | Context7 | Tavily search |
| Current news/info | Tavily search | Browserbase |
| Web scraping | Browserbase | Playwright |
| UI testing | Playwright | Browserbase |
| Verify claims | Strawberry | Context7 + Tavily |
| PR/Issue management | GitHub | Bash (gh CLI) |
| Run untrusted code | E2B | Docker sandbox |
| Complex planning | Sequential Thinking | Planning skill |
| Security review | security-review skill | Strawberry |
| CI/CD setup | devsecops skill | GitHub Actions docs |

## Quick Reference

### Documentation (Context7)
```
"Use Context7 to find [library] docs for [feature]"
"What's the correct [config] according to Context7?"
```

### Web Search (Tavily)
```
"Search for current [topic] information"
"Use Tavily to research [subject]"
```

### Browser Automation (Browserbase/Playwright)
```
"Use Browserbase to extract data from [URL]"
"Use Playwright to test [UI workflow]"
```

### Verification (Strawberry)
```
"Run Strawberry check on this implementation plan"
"Verify these claims before finalizing"
```

### Repository Operations (GitHub)
```
"Create a PR for this feature branch"
"List open issues with label 'bug'"
"Check the CI status for this PR"
```

### Sandboxed Execution (E2B)
```
"Run this script in a sandbox first"
"Test the migration in an isolated environment"
"Validate this build script safely"
```

### Problem Decomposition (Sequential Thinking)
```
"Use sequential thinking to plan this architecture"
"Break down this problem step by step"
"Analyze the trade-offs between approaches"
```

## Session State

When working on a project:
1. Check for `PROJECT.md` - project context
2. Check for `STATE.md` - current session state
3. Check for `ROADMAP.md` - planned work
4. Update `STATE.md` with decisions and progress

## Output Requirements

Always provide:
- **Exact commands** to run
- **Exact file paths** (absolute when possible)
- **Expected output** for verification
- **Rollback steps** for risky changes
